This project was part of the beginning Udemy.com iPhone course I took, "iOS 9 and Swift 2: From Beginner to Paid Professional," by Mark Price, lectures 53-57.

Features:

Multiple ViewControllers.
Drag and drop images.
Synchronized music and sound effects.
Uses size classes for item layouts in portrait vs landscape mode.

Issues:

1. The monster image canvases were much larger than the contained image. The instruction
    video said nothing about this, and to get the image to show on all screens, you had to
    do some odd offset positioning. I fixed this by using Gimp to trim all the graphics.

    It wasn't until later that I found there was an unstated reason for this offset. The
    monster takes a radically different shape, and the excess canvas size enabled a consistent
    scaling throughout this change. I had to go back and re-do the monster graphics to fix.

2. This same issue affected the extended assignment. Choosing the new characters, which have
    different sizes and aspect ratios, caused them to appear off center.

3. In landscape mode, with the original monster, double-clicking the heart or meat
    acts like dragging. Doesn't work in portrait or with the newer characters. I did a bit
    of surgery on the original monster graphics

4. Originally, both the grub and luv images are avialable at the start of the game,
    enabling the user to choose how to make the monster happy. I took the randomized code
    and put it into a separate function, and called that rom ViewController.viewDidLoad.

5. I used a prev/next navigator to enable the user to pick a custom character. I'd wanted to
    display all three, but due to the character base images all being different sizes, the
    layouts would never line up. So I went with the single button select.
